# Voter-Machine-Using-MATLAB
In this project, a demo software program using MATLAB based graphical user interface (GUI) to demonstrate the working of an EVM is presented. GUIDE is used to develop the GUI for this demo project, with components like "Static Text" to display Party Name, Votes, Votes Percentage, and "Push Button" components are used as Vote, Result and Reset Buttons. The logic is this demo project is very simple, for each party we have created a global variable, which is declared and initialized. So some of the additional feature of this project are as follows:  Voters who's names and Id's are present in Database can only vote. Duplicate Voting is not allowed. Voting Percentage is also calculated. So with the above mentioned features one can create a more robust and professional system. To create database, Microsoft Excel is used and names of voters and there voting id's are written in two different columns. For this project a sample database of 50 voters is created. We have the database now, and then in system we have to load this data, and based on the ID's we have to take action whether a voter can vote or not. Whenever someone presses the voting button, system will asks for its voting id and then search the voting id in its database.
